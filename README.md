Car Price Prediction ML Project
Overview
This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. The dataset includes features such as car name, model, year, distance traveled, and fuel type.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

Car Name: The name of the car.
Model: The model of the car.
Year: The manufacturing year of the car.
Distance Travelled: The distance traveled by the car (in kilometers).
Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the car.
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models/: Saved trained models.
README.md: This file, containing project information and instructions.
